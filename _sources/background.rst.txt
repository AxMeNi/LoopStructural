Background
==========
LoopStructural is an opensource Python 3.6+ library for 3D geological modelling where geological objects are represented by an implicit function. 
Where the implicit function represents the distance or pseudodistance to a reference horizion. 
The implicit function is approximated from the observations of the surface, for example locations of the geological feature or the orientation of the geological feature.
This is calculated by is a function that is an approximation of observations of the geological objects. using implicit functions.
