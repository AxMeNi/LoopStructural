Introduction
------------
The Introduction section provides a starting point for users new to LoopStructural. 
These examples walk through the basic functionality of the library, showing how to build simple geological models from the ground up. 
You'll learn how to load structural data, such as orientation measurements and fault surfaces, and use them to generate implicit 3D models of geological structures. 
This section is designed to help users familiarize themselves with the core features of LoopStructural, offering step-by-step examples that demonstrate its power and flexibility in creating geologically realistic models. 
Whether you're just getting started or need a quick reference for the basic workflow, these examples will guide you through the essentials of LoopStructural.
