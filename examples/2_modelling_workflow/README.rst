Modelling Workflows
------------------------
This section focuses on the advanced structural geology modelling algorithms built into LoopStructural. 
At the base of all structures in LoopStructural is the StructuralFrame, a curvilinear coodinate system that allows for the complex geometries of geological structures to be represented in simple coordinate systems.
The structural frames have three main coordinates:

1. The major structural feature measures the distance to the main structural feature
2. The structural direction measures the distance along the main structural direction of the object
3. An intermediate direction orthogonal to 1 and 2.

These coordinates are built to represent the directions of the finite strain ellipsoid and can help for modelling folds, faults and intrusions.
